Use data from Berkeley SETI's Automated Planet Finder to plot a 2D spectrum of Tabby's Star and extract a 1D spectrum which can be used to determine the star's H-Alpha line and radial velocity via Gaussian curvefitting. Repeated process with data from ESOâ€™s Library of Stellar Spectra for various star types (OBAFGKM) and compare their results.
